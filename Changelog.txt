- Reduced spread shotgun (Ballistic, Gauss, Plasma) aim bonus from 20 to 16.

- Legio Patria Nostra Will bonus increased from 1 per nationality to 2.

- Enemy aim updated to be more variable.

v1.4 Changes:

++ Firestorm revamped as Cruiser-type aircraft; slower than interceptor but much tougher, use for sustained bombing runs against medium to large targets.
++ Laser Cannon now "bomb" tech.
++ Plasma Cannon now efficient hybrid tech.
++ XCOM air weaponry descriptions updated.

- Mex vision returned to LW standard (27) for soldiers and all aliens as it causes numerous crash bugs w/ height and mixed vision ranges. Heavier enemies (and SHIV) sight range lower in general (24), esp. Mechtoids (21).
- Fix SHIV accuracy (+12 base, plus tech bonuses)

Balance Adjustments:

++ Now [Grants Light 'Em Up]

v1.2 Changes:

Balance Adjustments:
- Change barracks to 60 soldiers.
- Remove proper names from perk associations.
- Reduced research time of beam and adv. beam tech. Beam is a kind of ballistic 1.5 instead of a full tech advance like Gauss, Pulse, Plasma.
- Reduce interceptor arming time.
- Reduced cost and time to build Phoenix Cannon.
- Reduced interceptor max repair time by 20%. ~2/3rds of LW standard.
- Engineer bonus/penalty time to build reduced by 1/3rd.
- Sniper - Replaced Mayhem w/ Bring 'Em On (functions at squadsight range).
- Gunner - Replaced Flush w/ Squadsight.
- Gene Mod times reduced.
- Toned down diminishing returns cost.
- Additional Sectoid health: +2 in the first month.
- Additional Floater health: +3 by end of the second month.
- Prevalence of Hardened for non-mechanical enemies increased as part of the weapon rebalance. This generally represents well-armored or difficult to snipe/burst-fire enemies.
- Added -1 mobility to Muscle Fiber Density and Lightning Reflexes in the Sleeper perk tree. 
- Remove AP Ammo from Sniper class to keep Slayer as high level sniper perk.
- Increased Neural Damping extra fatigue to 24 hrs. Should affect all sleepers.
- Reduce Soldier cost to 45.
- Increased starting soldiers amount to 24.
- Put Field Surgeon on medikit and re-theme Regen Biofield as First Responder for the Command perk tree.
- Rocket Launcher damage returned to 7.
- Reduced avg. Soldier Will by 5 to account for psi-level Will gain availability. Back loaded soldier Will gain as well. Consider trophies/steadfast.

Aim and Weapon adjustments:
- Explanation: There are now distinctly crit focused weapons and others that provide raw damage or a lesser mix of both damage and critical chance.
- Enemies with Hardened and Resilience (Badass on enemies) are significantly more common. Enemies with these perks are generally poor targets for high crit weapons. 
++ High crit weapons (Machine Pistols, PDWs, non-beam Shotguns, Sniper rifles, LMGs) can be terribly effective and generally represent weapons that burst-fire, strike exposed areas, and may still be able to crit hardened targets opponents.
++ Low crit weapons (Carbines, Beam shotguns, Battle Rifle, Cannons) are relatively effective against all targets though incredibly unlikely to crit against Hardened targets.
++ Mixed weapons (Marksman Rifles, Assault Rifles) can go one way or the other depending on specialization, circumstances, or loadout.

- Standard Weapons: Range bonus applies starting at near visual range (24 rng). General bonus should be 2-56% over non-squadsight ranges. This includes Gunner weapons which have been further adjusted.
- Shotguns: Ballistic/Gauss/Plasma shotguns (Scattershot) damage output shifted onto critical hits. Lower base damange -2, high critical chance +20%. No accuracy bonus but accuracy gain from distance is 50% better than rifles and on the same scale.
- Shotguns: Beam/Pulse (Energy) reduced absolute range, though excellent accuracy within that range. High base damage, lower critical chance (-20%).
- Precision Weapons: Marksman/Sniper rifles now lose accuracy quickly at close-to-mid ranges (<24 rng, just short of max visual range). Damage output shifted towards critical hits. Lower base damage (-1 dmg), higher crit chance (32/48).
- Gunner Weapons: LMG-type weapons have somewhat poorer aim though their perks mitigate this. Cannon-type weapons now have Steady Aim and reduced accuracy. Non-Lasers have Flush instead of Death Dealer.
- Pistols: Machine pistols - Lower damage (-1), higher crit chance (~64).
- Reworked PDWs - Lower damage (-1), higher crit chance (~64), relatively poor aim.
- Aim bonus: -20 to the average aim statistic of all characters, enemy weapon aim reduced slightly. Significant aim bonuses are now standard on most weapons. +16 is the "average" aim bonus for weapons.
- Added Flush to Drum Magazines.

Tech Adjustments:
- Research time decreased by ~20%. 
- Weapon tech fragments reduced by ~25% and Elerium costs increased by ~50%.
- Fragments added to all non-autopsy/interrogation researches.
- Interrogation captures needed generally increased.
- Differentiate foundry projects from other research. High resource cost, quick research time. Reduced project time by ~85%. Increased elerium, meld, and alloy costs by ~50%.

Psionics:
- Training attempts much faster.
- Post-mission fatigue increased substantially for first perk. Otherwise reduced or same.
- Added mundane perk column. Death Dealer, Killzone, Squadsight, Precision, Steadfast.
- Rebalanced required XP: The first two psi levels are easy to acquire, the next two take quite a while, then two quick levels, and the last takes a long time.
- Make Psi accessible to all soldiers.
- Adjust required techs for psi powers.
++ Mundane perks grant no additional XP growth.
++ Offensive psi abilities have lesser XP growth, lower fatigue penalties?
++ Defensive psi abilities have greater XP growth, higher fatigue penalties?
++ Put passive psi powers on items. Note that Neural Feedback, Distortion Field, and possible First Responder will grant bonus PSI XP when gained from equipped items.

Fixes/Misc:
- Inf Loop Fix Attempt - Seeker lockup due to triggered or extra action. Make Seeekers stranglier.
- Ranger no longer replaces Pyrokinesis.
- Changed Deadzone perk to Killzone. Too much 'dead' in my perks.
